ðŸ“˜ Brief Description of the Notebook: Potato Leaves Detection Using ML

Objective

The notebook aims to build a machine learning or deep learning model to detect diseases in potato leaves using image data. It classifies images into categories such as healthy or infected leaves.

ðŸ§¾ Sections Overview

1. Importing Libraries

Common libraries are imported, including:
	â€¢	TensorFlow / Keras
	â€¢	NumPy
	â€¢	Matplotlib
	â€¢	OS and pathlib for file handling

2. Data Loading & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Uses image_dataset_from_directory() to load training, validation, and test datasets.
	â€¢	Dataset is structured into subfolders by class (e.g., Potato___Late_blight, Potato___Early_blight, Potato___healthy).
	â€¢	Applies batching and resizing.

3. Dataset Visualization
	â€¢	Displays sample images from the dataset.
	â€¢	Shows class names and image shapes.

4. Model Creation
	â€¢	A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is defined using tf.keras.Sequential().
	â€¢	The model includes Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.

5. Model Compilation & Training
	â€¢	Model is compiled with:
	â€¢	Loss: sparse_categorical_crossentropy
	â€¢	Optimizer: adam
	â€¢	Metrics: accuracy
	â€¢	Trained using model.fit() with training and validation datasets.

6. Model Evaluation
	â€¢	Plots accuracy and loss graphs for both training and validation sets.
	â€¢	Uses matplotlib to visualize performance over epochs.

7. Prediction on New Images
	â€¢	Defines a custom predict() function to:
	â€¢	Process a single image
	â€¢	Get the predicted label and confidence score
	â€¢	Visualizes prediction results on test samples.

8. Error Handling & Debugging
	â€¢	Several cells include debugging steps to fix:
	â€¢	Typos (validation_dataset â†’ validation_data)
	â€¢	Misuse of .numpy() on already-converted arrays
	â€¢	Incorrect variables (images vs image_batch)
	â€¢	Missing imports like numpy as np

âœ… Outcome

The model is successfully trained to classify potato leaves based on visual symptoms, and the prediction function works on test images.
